This lightweight distro incorporates many tools for analyzing Windows and Linux malware, examining browser-based threats such as obfuscated JavaScript, exploring suspicious document files and taking apart other malicious artifacts. Investigators can also use the distro to intercept suspicious network traffic in an isolated lab when performing behavioral malware analysis.\n\n\nDownload the REMnux Virtual Appliance\n\n\nThe simplest way to get the distro is to \ndownload the REMnux virtual appliance file\n in the OVA format. \n\n\nThe file is around 2GB in size; its SHA-256 hash is C26BE9831CA414F5A4D908D793E0B8934470B3887C48CFE82F86943236968AE6. You\nll need to install virtualization software such as \nVMware Player\n, \nVMware Workstation\n, \nVMware Fusion\n and \nVirtualBox\n prior to using the REMnux virtual appliance.\n\n\nOnce you\nve downloaded the REMnux OVA file, import it into your virtualization software, then start the virtual machine. For step-by-step instructions for importing the virtual appliance, take a look at the \nVirtualBox screenshot\n and \nVMware Workstation screenshot\n slideshows.\n\n\nThere is no need to extract contents of the OVA file manually before importing it. Simply load the OVA file into your virtualization software to begin the import. If you attempt to extract OVA file\ns contents and try importing the embedded OVF file in VirtualBox, you will likely encounter an error, such as \ncould not verify the content of REMnux.mf against the available files, unsupported digest type.\n\n\nOnce you boot up the imported virtual machine, it will automatically log you into the system using the user named \nremnux\n. The user\ns password is \nmalware\n; you might need to specify it when performing privileged operations.\n\n\nAfter booting into the virtual appliance, run the \nupdate-remnux full\n command on REMnux to update its software. This will allow you to benefit from any enhancements introduced after the virtual appliance has been packaged. Your system needs to have Internet access for this to work.\n\n\nInstall REMnux on an Existing System\n\n\nAs an alternative to downloading the virtual appliance, you can run the REMnux installation script on an existing Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit system. This allows you to install REMnux on a physical host or a virtual machine. You can use this method to add REMnux software and settings to a brand new system or to the host you\nve been using for a while. \nSIFT Workstation \n users can utilize this approach to combine SIFT and REMnux into a single system.\n\n\nIf you\nd like to build a REMnux system from scratch, use the \nUbuntu 14.04 64-bit minimal ISO\n as the starting point. If building a virtual machine, allocate at least 1GB of RAM and 25GB disk (more recommended). When going through the Ubuntu installer, consider creating the user named \nremnux\n with the password \nmalware\n, though any credentials will work. For step-by-step instructions, see the \nscreenshots of the Ubuntu installation steps\n.\n\n\nOnce you\nve logged into the newly-built or existing system compatible with REMnux, run the following command to install the REMnux distro:\n\n\nwget --quiet -O - https://remnux.org/get-remnux.sh | sudo bash\n\n\n\nThis installation script will configure your system and download and install the necessary software without asking you any questions. It requires Internet access to accomplish this. The installer will run for approximately 45 minutes, depending on the strength of your system and the speed of your Internet connection.\n\n\nA handful of people running the installation script within virtual machines noticed that the antivirus tool installed on their underlying host flagged some REMnux packages as malicious and blocked their download. This is a false alarm. However, if you encounter this, you might need to disable the host\ns anivirus tool while running the script or whitelist the offending files or URLs to avoid getting them blocked.\n\n\nConnecting the REMnux Virtual Appliance to the Internet\n\n\nThe REMnux virtual appliance is initially configured to use the \nNAT\n mode, so it can connect to the Internet through the host on which it is running. This way, if your underlying host has Internet connectivity, REMnux should be able to access the Internet as well. You can isolate REMnux within your lab by configuring the virtual appliance to use a \nhost only\n network. After switching networks, run the \nrenew-dhcp\n command in REMnux to refresh its network settings.\n\n\nSome of the REMnux tools are designed to run in an \nisolated laboratory environment\n, so you can perform behavioral analysis of malicious software running in the lab. In this case, configure REMnux use a virtual network without Internet connectivity. Other tools are designed to allow you to explore suspicious websites and interact with online resources; REMnux will need to be connected to an Internet-accessible network when performing these tasks.\n\n\nInstalling Virtualization Tools on REMnux\n\n\nWhen running REMnux on a VMware platform, it\ns usually a good idea to install VMware Tools within the virtual machine. This will allow the REMnux screen resolution to automatically adust to match your monitor\ns geometry. It will also provide some additional enhancements, such as the opportunity to share clipboard contents across your underlying host and the virtual machine.\n\n\nWhen running REMnux on VMware Workstation, Player or ESX, the simplest way to install VMware Tools using the open VM tools package by running the following command on REMnux, assuming it\ns connected to the Internet:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop\n\n\n\nOn VMware Fusion, the best approach is to install proprietary VMware Tools. To do this, activate the VMware Tools installation via Virtual Machine \n Install VMware Tools, then run the command \nsudo install-vmware-tools\n on REMnux. You can install VMware Tools this way on VMware Workstation and Player as well. For additional details, see the \nVMware article on this topic\n.\n\n\nPlease note that if you wish to use the shared folders feature of VMware, you will need to install proprietary VMware Tools with several adjustments to compensate for a compatibility issue between VMware Tools and the Ubuntu-supplied Linux kernel. These steps are described in an \narticle devoted to this topic\n. A more practical option for transferring files in and out of REMnux might be to use SFTP through the installed SSH server (\nsshd start\n) instead of using shared folders.\n\n\nIf using VirtualBox, consider installing Guest Additions software by following the \ninstructions provided by VirtualBox\n.\n\n\nUpdating Your REMnux System\n\n\nTo update REMnux after connecting your system to the Internet, simply run the \nupdate-remnux\n command. This tool will update the software that comprises the REMnux distribution, which includes the applications installed from standard Ubuntu and the REMnux-specific repository. The updater will also installed any tools added to the distro after your last update.",

Such images could be compared to lightweight virtual machines; though they don\nt offer the same level of isolation as real VMs, they provide a container within which the application can be encapsulated along with its dependencies.\n\n\nSee documentation below for more information and tune into the recorded webcast \nHow to Run Linux Malware Analysis Apps as Docker Containers\n.\n\n\nHow to Run Dockerized Applications?\n\n\nTo run REMnux-provided  application images, first you need to install Docker. This very easy to do on Linux (e.g. \nsudo apt-get install docker.io\n) and relatively painless on Windows and OS X. Just follow \nDocker\ns installation instructions\n for your operating system.\n\n\nOnce Docker is installed, you can run a Dockerized application by specifying the name of the desired app image. For example, to run the REMnux-provided image of \nThug\n, a low-interaction honeyclient, you would type something like \nsudo docker run --rm -it remnux/thug bash\n.\n\n\n\n\nDocker maintains the \nDocker Hub Registry\n of public application images. The \nREMnux repository\n of several malware analysis apps images is published there. For a listing of the available applications and guidelines for running them, see below.\n\n\nThe first time you run a Dockerized application, Docker will automatically download it from the Registry; your system will need to be connected to the Internet at that time. Afterwards, Docker will use a local copy of the image without relying on the Internet. If the application\ns image has been updated and you are connected to the Internet, Docker will automatically update your image when you run the app.\n\n\nHow Does Docker Work?\n\n\nDocker takes advantage of Linux kernels\n ability to run applications in containers, which are sometimes described as \nchroot on steroids.\n Containers provide each application an independent runtime environment, while avoiding the overhead of a full-fledged virtual machine.\n\n\nEach container gets its own virtual file system, process listing and network stack; however, containers share the OS kernel with each other and the underlying host. In this respect, the isolation provided by containers is less robust than that of real virtual machines, which have independent kernels and run on top of a hypervisor. Yet, sharing the kernel allows containers to run faster and offers management features that are difficult to accomplish with traditional virtualization.\n\n\nAn application distributed as a Docker image incorporates all the dependencies and configuration necessary for it to run, eliminating the need for end-users to install packages and troubleshoot dependencies. This approach allows developers to be certain that if the application worked in dev, it will work in production. Docker provides the tools necessary to build, run and manage applications packaged as Docker images.\n\n\nBenefits of Applications as Containers\n\n\nIn many cases, it is convenient to launch malware analysis tools the traditional way by running them directly on the OS, for instance taking advantage of the packages preinstalled as part of the \nREMnux distribution\n. Alternatively, you might want to run a tool without installing it directly onto your system, perhaps because you want to keep your system unclattered, or because it lacks the dependencies necessary to run the application.\n\n\nWhen running the app as a Docker container, you\nre able to take advantage of the image developer\ns efforts to figure out how to properly set up the application. Also, you get to benefit from any updates that the application\ns developer and the image maintainer introduces without having to worry how to install them.\n\n\nBecause Docker images are mostly independent of each other, you can run applications in environments separate from each other and the underlying system; this is especially useful when applications rely on conflicting dependencies. Because Docker containers are more lightweight than virtual machines, it\ns more practical to dedicate a container to a single app than trying to set up a VM per application.\n\n\nA Redhat article outlines \nadditional benefits that Docker offers\n, which include:\n\n\n\n\nRapid application deployment\n\n\nPortability across machines\n\n\nVersion control and component reuse\n\n\nSimplified maintenance\n\n\n\n\nLastly, those who are trying to install applications directly on their system without Docker can examine the Dockerfile config for the desired application to see explicit, scriptable instructions for installing the app into their own environment.\n\n\nDocker containers have their limitations and sometimes it\ns easier to run applications the traditional way.

The following page explains which applications are available as images and how to run them, assuming you\nve installed Docker on your underlying host.\n\n\nOnce you\nve installed the desired image, as outlined below, you can update it by using the \ndocker pull\n command (e.g., \nsudo docker pull remnux/radare2\n). To update all locally-cached images, run:\n\n\nsudo docker images |cut -d' ' -f1 | grep -v REPOSITORY | xargs -I %s sudo docker pull %s\n\n\n\nGoogle\ns V8 JavaScript Engine: remnux/v8\n\n\nGoogle\ns V8 JavaScript Engine\n can be useful for obfuscating JavaScript embedded in malicious browser pages and PDF files. The REMnux image of this application is available in the the Docker Hub Registry as \nremnux/v8\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to use V8 is to invoke it by first running \nbash\n or another shell within its container, and then running the \nd8\n command:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it remnux/v8 bash\n\n\n\nHowever, since you\nll probably want to provide some files for V8 to examine and get some files back, you will probably want to invoke Docker with the \n-v\n parameter to specify a shared directory that the container and the underlying host will be able to access:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files remnux/v8 bash\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the ~/files directory will be shared between your host and the container. Before running the command above, make sure that ~/files exists and that its permissions are world-readable (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr\n).\n\n\nThe remnux/v8 image includes a file that defines several objects, methods and properties that malicious JavaScript scripts running in a standalone interpreter will require. This file is located within the container in the ~/def.js location. You might need to modify it to address the needs of your sample.\n\n\nOnce in the container, you might want to invoke the V8 application using a command like this:\n\n\nd8 -f ~/def.js ~/files/file.js\n\n\n\nThug Low-Interaction Honeyclient: remnux/thug\n\n\nThug\n low-interaction honeyclient can assist with the analysis of suspicious websites. The REMnux image of this application is available in the the Docker Hub Registry as \nremnux/thug\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to use Thug is to invoke it by first running \nbash\n or another shell within its container, and then running the \n./thug.py\n command:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it remnux/thug bash\n\n\n\nIf you will want to save the log files that Thug creates when assessing the designated website, you will want to invoke Docker with the \n-v\n parameter to specify a shared directory that the container and the underlying host will be able to access:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/logs:/home/thug/logs remnux/thug bash\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the ~/logs directory will be shared between your host and the container. Before running the command above, make sure that ~/logs exists and that its permissions are world-readable (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr\n). If you\nd like to share an additional directory (e.g., \nfiles\n), supply the mapping using another -v parameter such as \n-v ~/files:/home/thug/files\n and remember to make the directory on your host world-accessible.\n\n\nOnce in the container, you might want to invoke the Thug application using a command like this:\n\n\n./thug.py http://example.com\n\n\n\nIf you want Thug to examine a single website and don\nt need an interactive shell, you could run its image like this:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/logs:/home/thug/logs remnux/thug ./thug.py http://example.com\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we launched the Thug image and specified that the command to run within it should be \n./thug.py http://example.com\n. We also directed Docker to share the underlying host\ns ~/log directory, which is where Thug saved the results of its analysis.\n\n\n\n\nViper Binary Analysis Framework: remnux/viper\n\n\nViper\n is \na binary management and analysis framework dedicated to malware and exploit researchers.\n It\ns useful to examine samples and maintain historical records about prior investigations. The REMnux image of this application is available in the the Docker Hub Registry as \nremnux/viper\n.\n\n\n\n\nOne way to launch Viper is to simply run its container:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it remnux/viper\n\n\n\nThis will automatically launch the tool. Alternatively, you could start the container by first running \nbash\n or another shell in it, and then running the \n../viper/viper.py\n command with the desired parameters:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it remnux/viper bash\n\n\n\nHowever, you\nll probably want to share a directory between the container and your underlying host, so that Viper can read your samples and save its analysis. To do this, invoke Docker with the \n-v\n parameter to specify a shared directory that the container and the underlying host will be able to access:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/viper-workdir:/home/nonroot/workdir remnux/viper\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the ~/viper-workdir directory will be shared between your host and the container. Before running the command above, make sure that ~/viper-workdir exists and that its permissions are world-readable (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr\n).\n\n\nRekall Memory Forensic Framework: remnux/rekall\n\n\nRekall\n is a collection of tools for the extraction and analysis of artifacts from memory images. The REMnux image of this application is available in the the Docker Hub Registry as \nremnux/rekall\n.\n\n\n\n\nOne way to launch Rekall is to start the container by first running \nbash\n or another shell in it, and then running the \nrekall\n command with the desired parameters:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it remnux/rekall bash\n\n\n\nHowever, you\nll probably want to share a directory between the container and your underlying host, so that Rekall can read your memory image files and save its output. To do this, invoke Docker with the \n-v\n parameter to specify a shared directory that the container and the underlying host will be able to access:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files remnux/rekall bash\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the ~/files directory will be shared between your host and the container. Before running the command above, make sure that ~/files exists and that its permissions are world-readable (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr\n).\n\n\nTo use Rekall\ns web console, instead of its command-line interface, invoke the container with the -p parameter to give your host access to the container\ns TCP port 8000 like this:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files remnux/rekall\n\n\n\nThen connect to http://localhost:8000 using a web browser from your underlying host. To stop the container running in this mode, press \nCtrl+C\n in its terminal window.\n\n\nJSDetox JavaScript Analysis Tool: remnux/jsdetox\n\n\nJSDetox\n is a web-based tool for analyzing and deobfuscating JavaScript. The REMnux image of this application is available in the the Docker Hub Registry as \nremnux/jsdetox\n.\n\n\n\n\nOne way to launch JSDetox, run its container like this:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 remnux/jsdetox\n\n\n\nThen connect to http://localhost:3000 using a web browser from your underlying host.\n\n\nTo stop the JSDetox container, run \nsudo docker ps -l\n on your host to obtain the container ID, then use the \nsudo docker stop\ncontainer-id` command and wait about a minute, where \ncontainer-id\n is the ID of the JSDetox container.\n\n\nHelp expand this collection! You can put together Dockerfile configs for building Docker images of malware analysis applications that are not yet present in the repository. To do this, follow the guidelines in the article \nCreating Docker Images for REMnux\n.\n\n\nRadare2 Reverse Engineering Framework: remnux/radare2\n\n\nRadare2\n is a reverse-engineering framework that includes a disassembler and other capabilities useful for analyzing malicious code. The REMnux image of this application is available in the the Docker Hub Registry as \nremnux/radare2\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo use Radare2, first run \nbash\n or another shell in its container and then specify the \nrd2\n command with the desired parameters. You\nll probably want to share a directory between the container and your underlying host, so that Radare2 can read your samples and save its output. To do this, invoke Docker with the \n-v\n parameter to specify a shared directory that the container and the underlying host will be able to access:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/workdir:/home/nonroot/workdir remnux/radare2 bash\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the ~/workdir directory will be shared between your host and the container. Before running the command above, make sure that ~/workdir exists and that its permissions are world-readable (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr\n).\n\n\nPescanner Static Malware Analysis Tool: remnux/pescanner\n\n\nPescaner\n is a static malware analysis tool for examining suspicious Windows PE files. It was created by created by \nMichael Ligh\n and distributed with the book \nMalware Analyst Cookbook\n. The REMnux collection uses the \nversion of this tool\n that was modified by \nGlenn P. Edwards Jr.\n to introduce \nimphash\n support.\n\n\n\n\nTo use pescanner, first run \nbash\n or another shell in its container and then specify the \npescanner\n command, followed by the path to the file you\nd like to examine. You\nll probably want to share a directory between the container and your underlying host, so that pescanner can access your samples. To do this, invoke Docker with the \n-v\n parameter to specify a shared directory that the container and the underlying host will be able to access:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/workdir:/home/nonroot/workdir remnux/pescanner bash\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the ~/workdir directory will be shared between your host and the container. Before running the command above, make sure that ~/workdir exists and that its permissions are world-readable (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr\n).\n\n\nThe Volatility Framework for Memory Forensics: remnux/volatility\n\n\nThe Volatility Framework\n for Memory Forensics is a set of libraries and modules for examining memory images for malware and forensic artifacts.\n\n\n\n\nTo use Volatility, first run  \nbash\n or another shell in its container and then specify the \nvol.py\n command with the desired parameters:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it remnux/volatility bash\n\n\n\nHowever, you\nll probably want to share a directory between the container and your underlying host, so that Volatility can read your memory image files and save its output. To do this, invoke Docker with the \n-v\n parameter to specify a shared directory that the container and the underlying host will be able to access:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/memdumps:/home/nonroot/memdumps remnux/volatility bash\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the ~/memdumps directory will be shared between your host and the container. Before running the above, make sure that ~/memdumps exists and that all users have the ability to read from and write to that directory and its contents (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr\n).\n\n\nMASTIFF Static Analysis Framework: remnux/mastiff\n\n\nMASTIFF\n is a framework for automatically extracting key static properties from suspicious files.\n\n\n\n\nTo use MASTIFF, first run \nbash\n or another shell in its container and then specify the \nmas.py\n command with the appropriate parameters.

Also, familiarize yourself with the approaches to \nrunning images that have already been created\n as part of the REMnux project. Next, review the guidelines and examples below. Lastly, read Docker\ns documentation for \nbuilding images using a Dockerfile\n.\n\n\nDocumenting the Build Steps in Dockerfile\n\n\nA properly-formatted Dockerfile describes the steps necessary to build and configure your application inside a Docker container in a repeatable and unattended manner. To get a sense for the structure of such files, browse the \nREMnux repository of Dockerfiles on Github\n. To explain how to build such files, we\nll use the \nJSDetox Dockerfile\n as an example.\n\n\nThe beginning of your Dockerfile should include comments that state which application is included in the image, who created the app and where it can be obtained in a traditional form. The comments should explain how the use of the image should run it. For instance:\n\n\n# This Docker image encapsulates the JSDetox malware analysis tool by @sven_t\n# from http://www.relentless-coding.com/projects/jsdetox\n#\n# To run this image after installing Docker, use the following command:\n# sudo docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 remnux/jsdetox\n# Then, connect to http://localhost:3000 using your web browser.\n\n\n\nREMnux images use a minimal Docker image of Ubuntu 14.04 as a starting point, as designated by the \nFROM\n directive below. The \nMAINTAINER\n tag explains who created and/or maintains the Dockerfile:\n\n\nFROM ubuntu:14.04\nMAINTAINER Lenny Zeltser (@lennyzeltser, www.zeltser.com)\n\n\n\nThe \nRUN\n directive below tells Docker which commands to run  inside the container when building the image. Your Dockerfile file should include the \napt-get update\n command, followed by \napt-get install -y\n and a listing of the Ubuntu packages that the application requires. Remember that the starting point for the image is a minimal Ubuntu installation, so assume that a given package is not present unless you explicitly install it:\n\n\nUSER root\nRUN apt-get update \n apt-get install -y \\\n  git \\\n  ruby \\\n  ruby-dev \\\n  bundler \\\n  build-essential \n \\\n  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n\n\nThe \nUSER\n directive above makes sure that Docker will run the \napt-get\n commands as root. Note that the \nRUN\n command above links several commands together using \n and employs \n\\\n to break this sequence of commands into multiple lines for better readability. We\nre linking several commands in this manner to slightly minimize the size of the resulting Docker image file. This is also the reason why we include the \nrm\n command to get rid of the package listing.\n\n\nThe followng \nRUN\n directive sets up the non-root user creatively named \nnonroot\n, so that commands and applications that don\nt require root provileges have a more restricted environment within which to run. Note that just as before, we\nre using \n to string together multiple commands, separating lines with \n\\\n:\n\n\nRUN groupadd -r nonroot \n \\\n  useradd -r -g nonroot -d /home/nonroot -s /sbin/nologin -c \"Nonroot User\" nonroot \n \\\n  mkdir /home/nonroot \n \\\n  chown -R nonroot:nonroot /home/nonroot\n\n\n\nThe next set of directives tells Docker to start running commands using the newly-set up \nnonroot\n user, defines the working directory to match that user\ns home directory and retrieves the code for the application we\nre installing (JSDetox, in this case):\n\n\nUSER nonroot\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot\nRUN git clone https://github.com/svent/jsdetox.git\n\n\n\nThe following instructions will install the application using the \nbundle install\n command, according the JSDetox installation instructions. Note that these instructions need to run as root to have the ability to copy the application\ns files into protected locations:\n\n\nUSER root\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot/jsdetox\nRUN bundle install\n\n\n\nThe final set of directives below tells Docker to switch back to using the \nnonroot\n user and sets the working directory to the location from which JSDetox should be launched. It also specifies which command Docker should run when this image is launched without any parameters:\n\n\nUSER nonroot\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot/jsdetox\nCMD ./jsdetox -l $HOSTNAME 2\n/dev/null\n\n\n\nBy default, JSDetox listens on \nlocalhost\n. To give us the opportunity to connect to JSDetox from outside of its container, the command above launches the tool with the \n-l\n parameter and specifies the $HOSTNAME varilable. This environment variable is automatically defined to match the hostname that Docker will assign when this container runs, which will allow JSDetox to listen on the network interface accessible from our underlying host.\n\n\nBuilding the App Image from the Dockerfile\n\n\nYour underlying system will need to be connected to the Internet when you build the Docker image, so that it can retrieve the necessary files when installing the application. Also, you\nll need to understand what is involved in setting up the app, including knowing its dependencies and configuration nuances.\n\n\nIt\ns difficult to create a Dockerfile, such as the one we reviewed above, in one shot. Inevitably, some command will run in a manner that you don\nt expect, preventing the application from installing properly. Before documenting your steps in Dockerfile, consider launching the base ubuntu:14.04 container like this:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it ubuntu:14.04 bash\n\n\n\nThen, manually type and write down the commands into the container\ns shell to install the desired application. Once you\nve validated that a specific sequence of commands works, start building a Dockerfile by adding your instructions one or two at a time to validate that they work as intended.\n\n\nOnce you\nve created a Dockerfile that contains the desired directives, go to the directory where the file is present and run the following command, where \nimage-name\n is he name you\nd like to assign to the image file you\nre building:\n\n\nsudo docker build -t=image-name .\n\n\n\nBuilding the image can take some time, depending on the speed of your system and Internet connection, as Docker downloads the necessary packages and, if appropriate, compiles code.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Docker builds the image, you can run it using the following command to get a shell in the container where your application has been installed:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it image-name bash\n\n\n\nOf course, \nimage-name\n in the command above should correspond to the name you\nve assigned to the image. The \n--rm\n parameter in the command above directs Docker to automatically remove the container once it finishes running. This gets rid of any changes the application may have made to the local environment when it ran, but does not remove the cached image file that represents the app on your system. The \n-it\n parameter requests that Docker open an interactive session to the container and assign a pseudo-TTY to it so you can interact with it.\n\n\nOnce you have built and tested your Dockerfile, \nshare it with Lenny Zeltser\n, so he can review it and, if appropriate, incorporate your contribution into the REMnux repository \non Github\n and \non the Docker Hub Registry\n.\n\n\nFacilitating File System and Network Interactions\n\n\nThe container will be isolated from the host system: by default it will be able to communicate over the network in the outbound direction, but won\nt accept inbound traffic. Also, if the container is invoked with the \n--rm\n parameter, its contents will  disappear after it stops running. When building the image, you might need to anticipate the user\ns need to communicate with the app inside the container over the network or to pass files in and out of the container.\n\n\nAccessing Network Ports in the Container\n\n\nIn the JSDetox example above, the application listens on TCP port 3000. In its default configuration, JSDetox listens on localhost, which would make its port inaccessible from outside its Docker container. This is why we launched JSDetox with the \n-l $HOSTNAME\n parameter\nthis directed the application to listen on the network interface that could be accessed from outside the container.\n\n\nUnless the user explicitly requests access to the container\ns port when launching its image, no ports will be accessible from the underlying system. Fortunately, Docker allows us to use the \n-p\n parameter to specify that a specific port within the container should be accessible from outside the container. For example, to access JSDetox\n port 3000, the user needs to specify \n-p 3000:3000\n. This maps the container\ns port 3000 to the underlying host\ns port 3000, allowing the user to communicate with JSDetox by connecting to http://localhost:3000 using a web browser.\n\n\nSharing Files with the Container\n\n\nThere is no need to share files with JSDetox inside the container by using the file system, because this application interacts with the user through the web browser. In contrast, some files expect the user to provide input or share output via the file system. Docker supports the \n-v\n parameter to share a directory between the underlying host and the container.\n\n\nFor example, let\ns say we wanted to share a folder with the container running the \nRekall Memory Forensic Framework\n, which is \navailable from the REMnux Docker repository\n. If the memory image file that you\nd like to analyze is located on your underlying host in the ~/files directory, you could share that directory with the Rekall container by specifying \n-v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files\n when running the application\ns image:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files remnux/rekall bash\n\n\n\nThis maps the local ~/files directory to the /home/nonroot/files directory inside the container. The Rekall image is built to run the user-designated command (e.g., \nbash\n) as the user \nnonroot\n. To ensure that the non-root user has access to the underlying hosts ~/files directory, the user of the app will need to make that directory world-accessible (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr ~/files\n) before launching the container.\n\n\nThe comments in the beginning of your Dockerfile should provide guidelines for how the image should be launched to ensure that the user can provide files and communicate with ports.",

Note that just as before, we re using   to string together multiple commands, separating lines with  \\ :  RUN groupadd -r nonroot   \\\n  useradd -r -g nonroot -d /home/nonroot -s /sbin/nologin -c \"Nonroot User\" nonroot   \\\n  mkdir /home/nonroot   \\\n  chown -R nonroot:nonroot /home/nonroot  The next set of directives tells Docker to start running commands using the newly-set up  nonroot  user, defines the working directory to match that user s home directory and retrieves the code for the application we re installing (JSDetox, in this case):  USER nonroot\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot\nRUN git clone https://github.com/svent/jsdetox.git  The following instructions will install the application using the  bundle install  command, according the JSDetox installation instructions. Note that these instructions need to run as root to have the ability to copy the application s files into protected locations:  USER root\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot/jsdetox\nRUN bundle install  The final set of directives below tells Docker to switch back to using the  nonroot  user and sets the working directory to the location from which JSDetox should be launched. It also specifies which command Docker should run when this image is launched without any parameters:  USER nonroot\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot/jsdetox\nCMD ./jsdetox -l $HOSTNAME 2 /dev/null  By default, JSDetox listens on  localhost . To give us the opportunity to connect to JSDetox from outside of its container, the command above launches the tool with the  -l  parameter and specifies the $HOSTNAME varilable. This environment variable is automatically defined to match the hostname that Docker will assign when this container runs, which will allow JSDetox to listen on the network interface accessible from our underlying host.",

            "text": "Your underlying system will need to be connected to the Internet when you build the Docker image, so that it can retrieve the necessary files when installing the application. Also, you ll need to understand what is involved in setting up the app, including knowing its dependencies and configuration nuances.  It s difficult to create a Dockerfile, such as the one we reviewed above, in one shot. Inevitably, some command will run in a manner that you don t expect, preventing the application from installing properly. Before documenting your steps in Dockerfile, consider launching the base ubuntu:14.04 container like this:  sudo docker run --rm -it ubuntu:14.04 bash  Then, manually type and write down the commands into the container s shell to install the desired application. Once you ve validated that a specific sequence of commands works, start building a Dockerfile by adding your instructions one or two at a time to validate that they work as intended.  Once you ve created a Dockerfile that contains the desired directives, go to the directory where the file is present and run the following command, where  image-name  is he name you d like to assign to the image file you re building:  sudo docker build -t=image-name .  Building the image can take some time, depending on the speed of your system and Internet connection, as Docker downloads the necessary packages and, if appropriate, compiles code.   After Docker builds the image, you can run it using the following command to get a shell in the container where your application has been installed:  sudo docker run --rm -it image-name bash  Of course,  image-name  in the command above should correspond to the name you ve assigned to the image. The  --rm  parameter in the command above directs Docker to automatically remove the container once it finishes running. This gets rid of any changes the application may have made to the local environment when it ran, but does not remove the cached image file that represents the app on your system. The  -it  parameter requests that Docker open an interactive session to the container and assign a pseudo-TTY to it so you can interact with it.  Once you have built and tested your Dockerfile,  share it with Lenny Zeltser , so he can review it and, if appropriate, incorporate your contribution into the REMnux repository  on Github  and  on the Docker Hub Registry .",

            "text": "The container will be isolated from the host system: by default it will be able to communicate over the network in the outbound direction, but won t accept inbound traffic. Also, if the container is invoked with the  --rm  parameter, its contents will  disappear after it stops running. When building the image, you might need to anticipate the user s need to communicate with the app inside the container over the network or to pass files in and out of the container.  Accessing Network Ports in the Container  In the JSDetox example above, the application listens on TCP port 3000. In its default configuration, JSDetox listens on localhost, which would make its port inaccessible from outside its Docker container. This is why we launched JSDetox with the  -l $HOSTNAME  parameter this directed the application to listen on the network interface that could be accessed from outside the container.  Unless the user explicitly requests access to the container s port when launching its image, no ports will be accessible from the underlying system. Fortunately, Docker allows us to use the  -p  parameter to specify that a specific port within the container should be accessible from outside the container. For example, to access JSDetox  port 3000, the user needs to specify  -p 3000:3000 . This maps the container s port 3000 to the underlying host s port 3000, allowing the user to communicate with JSDetox by connecting to http://localhost:3000 using a web browser.  Sharing Files with the Container  There is no need to share files with JSDetox inside the container by using the file system, because this application interacts with the user through the web browser. In contrast, some files expect the user to provide input or share output via the file system. Docker supports the  -v  parameter to share a directory between the underlying host and the container.  For example, let s say we wanted to share a folder with the container running the  Rekall Memory Forensic Framework , which is  available from the REMnux Docker repository . If the memory image file that you d like to analyze is located on your underlying host in the ~/files directory, you could share that directory with the Rekall container by specifying  -v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files  when running the application s image:  sudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files remnux/rekall bash  This maps the local ~/files directory to the /home/nonroot/files directory inside the container. The Rekall image is built to run the user-designated command (e.g.,  bash ) as the user  nonroot . To ensure that the non-root user has access to the underlying hosts ~/files directory, the user of the app will need to make that directory world-accessible (i.e.,  chmod a+xwr ~/files ) before launching the container.  The comments in the beginning of your Dockerfile should provide guidelines for how the image should be launched to ensure that the user can provide files and communicate with ports.",
