            "text": "One aspect of the REMnux project involves providing \nDocker\n images of popular malware analysis tools, with the goal of allowing investigators to conveniently utilize difficult-to-install applications without having to install the REMnux distro. Such images could be compared to lightweight virtual machines; though they don\nt offer the same level of isolation as real VMs, they provide a container within which the application can be encapsulated along with its dependencies.\n\n\nSee documentation below for more information and tune into the recorded webcast \nHow to Run Linux Malware Analysis Apps as Docker Containers\n.\n\n\nHow to Run Dockerized Applications?\n\n\nTo run REMnux-provided  application images, first you need to install Docker. This very easy to do on Linux (e.g. \nsudo apt-get install docker.io\n) and relatively painless on Windows and OS X. Just follow \nDocker\ns installation instructions\n for your operating system.\n\n\nOnce Docker is installed, you can run a Dockerized application by specifying the name of the desired app image. For example, to run the REMnux-provided image of \nThug\n, a low-interaction honeyclient, you would type something like \nsudo docker run --rm -it remnux/thug bash\n.\n\n\n\n\nDocker maintains the \nDocker Hub Registry\n of public application images. The \nREMnux repository\n of several malware analysis apps images is published there. For a listing of the available applications and guidelines for running them, see below.\n\n\nThe first time you run a Dockerized application, Docker will automatically download it from the Registry; your system will need to be connected to the Internet at that time. Afterwards, Docker will use a local copy of the image without relying on the Internet. If the application\ns image has been updated and you are connected to the Internet, Docker will automatically update your image when you run the app.\n\n\nHow Does Docker Work?\n\n\nDocker takes advantage of Linux kernels\n ability to run applications in containers, which are sometimes described as \nchroot on steroids.\n Containers provide each application an independent runtime environment, while avoiding the overhead of a full-fledged virtual machine.\n\n\nEach container gets its own virtual file system, process listing and network stack; however, containers share the OS kernel with each other and the underlying host. In this respect, the isolation provided by containers is less robust than that of real virtual machines, which have independent kernels and run on top of a hypervisor. Yet, sharing the kernel allows containers to run faster and offers management features that are difficult to accomplish with traditional virtualization.\n\n\nAn application distributed as a Docker image incorporates all the dependencies and configuration necessary for it to run, eliminating the need for end-users to install packages and troubleshoot dependencies. This approach allows developers to be certain that if the application worked in dev, it will work in production.

This very easy to do on Linux (e.g.  sudo apt-get install docker.io ) and relatively painless on Windows and OS X. Just follow  Docker s installation instructions  for your operating system.  Once Docker is installed, you can run a Dockerized application by specifying the name of the desired app image. For example, to run the REMnux-provided image of  Thug , a low-interaction honeyclient, you would type something like  sudo docker run --rm -it remnux/thug bash .   Docker maintains the  Docker Hub Registry  of public application images. The  REMnux repository  of several malware analysis apps images is published there. For a listing of the available applications and guidelines for running them, see below.  The first time you run a Dockerized application, Docker will automatically download it from the Registry; your system will need to be connected to the Internet at that time. Afterwards, Docker will use a local copy of the image without relying on the Internet. If the application s image has been updated and you are connected to the Internet, Docker will automatically update your image when you run the app.",

Containers provide each application an independent runtime environment, while avoiding the overhead of a full-fledged virtual machine.  Each container gets its own virtual file system, process listing and network stack; however, containers share the OS kernel with each other and the underlying host. In this respect, the isolation provided by containers is less robust than that of real virtual machines, which have independent kernels and run on top of a hypervisor. Yet, sharing the kernel allows containers to run faster and offers management features that are difficult to accomplish with traditional virtualization.  An application distributed as a Docker image incorporates all the dependencies and configuration necessary for it to run, eliminating the need for end-users to install packages and troubleshoot dependencies. This approach allows developers to be certain that if the application worked in dev, it will work in production.

To do this, invoke Docker with the  -v  parameter to specify a shared directory that the container and the underlying host will be able to access:  sudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/workdir:/home/nonroot/workdir remnux/pescanner bash  In the example above, the ~/workdir directory will be shared between your host and the container. Before running the command above, make sure that ~/workdir exists and that its permissions are world-readable (i.e.,  chmod a+xwr ).",

            "text": "Please contribute to the \nREMnux collection of Docker images\n of malware analysis applications. You\nll get a chance to experiment with Docker, become a master at setting up an application of your choice and expand the set of tools that other professionals can conveniently run for examining malicious software.\n\n\nAs a starting point, read the REMnux page regarding \nDocker and the notion of containers\n. Also, familiarize yourself with the approaches to \nrunning images that have already been created\n as part of the REMnux project. Next, review the guidelines and examples below. Lastly, read Docker\ns documentation for \nbuilding images using a Dockerfile\n.\n\n\nDocumenting the Build Steps in Dockerfile\n\n\nA properly-formatted Dockerfile describes the steps necessary to build and configure your application inside a Docker container in a repeatable and unattended manner. To get a sense for the structure of such files, browse the \nREMnux repository of Dockerfiles on Github\n. To explain how to build such files, we\nll use the \nJSDetox Dockerfile\n as an example.\n\n\nThe beginning of your Dockerfile should include comments that state which application is included in the image, who created the app and where it can be obtained in a traditional form. The comments should explain how the use of the image should run it. For instance:\n\n\n# This Docker image encapsulates the JSDetox malware analysis tool by @sven_t\n# from http://www.relentless-coding.com/projects/jsdetox\n#\n# To run this image after installing Docker, use the following command:\n# sudo docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 remnux/jsdetox\n# Then, connect to http://localhost:3000 using your web browser.\n\n\n\nREMnux images use a minimal Docker image of Ubuntu 14.04 as a starting point, as designated by the \nFROM\n directive below. The \nMAINTAINER\n tag explains who created and/or maintains the Dockerfile:\n\n\nFROM ubuntu:14.04\nMAINTAINER Lenny Zeltser (@lennyzeltser, www.zeltser.com)\n\n\n\nThe \nRUN\n directive below tells Docker which commands to run  inside the container when building the image. Your Dockerfile file should include the \napt-get update\n command, followed by \napt-get install -y\n and a listing of the Ubuntu packages that the application requires. Remember that the starting point for the image is a minimal Ubuntu installation, so assume that a given package is not present unless you explicitly install it:\n\n\nUSER root\nRUN apt-get update \n apt-get install -y \\\n  git \\\n  ruby \\\n  ruby-dev \\\n  bundler \\\n  build-essential \n \\\n  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n\n\nThe \nUSER\n directive above makes sure that Docker will run the \napt-get\n commands as root. Note that the \nRUN\n command above links several commands together using \n and employs \n\\\n to break this sequence of commands into multiple lines for better readability. We\nre linking several commands in this manner to slightly minimize the size of the resulting Docker image file. This is also the reason why we include the \nrm\n command to get rid of the package listing.\n\n\nThe followng \nRUN\n directive sets up the non-root user creatively named \nnonroot\n, so that commands and applications that don\nt require root provileges have a more restricted environment within which to run. Note that just as before, we\nre using \n to string together multiple commands, separating lines with \n\\\n:\n\n\nRUN groupadd -r nonroot \n \\\n  useradd -r -g nonroot -d /home/nonroot -s /sbin/nologin -c \"Nonroot User\" nonroot \n \\\n  mkdir /home/nonroot \n \\\n  chown -R nonroot:nonroot /home/nonroot\n\n\n\nThe next set of directives tells Docker to start running commands using the newly-set up \nnonroot\n user, defines the working directory to match that user\ns home directory and retrieves the code for the application we\nre installing (JSDetox, in this case):\n\n\nUSER nonroot\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot\nRUN git clone https://github.com/svent/jsdetox.git\n\n\n\nThe following instructions will install the application using the \nbundle install\n command, according the JSDetox installation instructions. Note that these instructions need to run as root to have the ability to copy the application\ns files into protected locations:\n\n\nUSER root\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot/jsdetox\nRUN bundle install\n\n\n\nThe final set of directives below tells Docker to switch back to using the \nnonroot\n user and sets the working directory to the location from which JSDetox should be launched. It also specifies which command Docker should run when this image is launched without any parameters:\n\n\nUSER nonroot\nWORKDIR /home/nonroot/jsdetox\nCMD ./jsdetox -l $HOSTNAME 2\n/dev/null\n\n\n\nBy default, JSDetox listens on \nlocalhost\n. To give us the opportunity to connect to JSDetox from outside of its container, the command above launches the tool with the \n-l\n parameter and specifies the $HOSTNAME varilable. This environment variable is automatically defined to match the hostname that Docker will assign when this container runs, which will allow JSDetox to listen on the network interface accessible from our underlying host.\n\n\nBuilding the App Image from the Dockerfile\n\n\nYour underlying system will need to be connected to the Internet when you build the Docker image, so that it can retrieve the necessary files when installing the application. Also, you\nll need to understand what is involved in setting up the app, including knowing its dependencies and configuration nuances.\n\n\nIt\ns difficult to create a Dockerfile, such as the one we reviewed above, in one shot. Inevitably, some command will run in a manner that you don\nt expect, preventing the application from installing properly. Before documenting your steps in Dockerfile, consider launching the base ubuntu:14.04 container like this:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it ubuntu:14.04 bash\n\n\n\nThen, manually type and write down the commands into the container\ns shell to install the desired application. Once you\nve validated that a specific sequence of commands works, start building a Dockerfile by adding your instructions one or two at a time to validate that they work as intended.\n\n\nOnce you\nve created a Dockerfile that contains the desired directives, go to the directory where the file is present and run the following command, where \nimage-name\n is he name you\nd like to assign to the image file you\nre building:\n\n\nsudo docker build -t=image-name .\n\n\n\nBuilding the image can take some time, depending on the speed of your system and Internet connection, as Docker downloads the necessary packages and, if appropriate, compiles code.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Docker builds the image, you can run it using the following command to get a shell in the container where your application has been installed:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it image-name bash\n\n\n\nOf course, \nimage-name\n in the command above should correspond to the name you\nve assigned to the image. The \n--rm\n parameter in the command above directs Docker to automatically remove the container once it finishes running. This gets rid of any changes the application may have made to the local environment when it ran, but does not remove the cached image file that represents the app on your system. The \n-it\n parameter requests that Docker open an interactive session to the container and assign a pseudo-TTY to it so you can interact with it.\n\n\nOnce you have built and tested your Dockerfile, \nshare it with Lenny Zeltser\n, so he can review it and, if appropriate, incorporate your contribution into the REMnux repository \non Github\n and \non the Docker Hub Registry\n.\n\n\nFacilitating File System and Network Interactions\n\n\nThe container will be isolated from the host system: by default it will be able to communicate over the network in the outbound direction, but won\nt accept inbound traffic. Also, if the container is invoked with the \n--rm\n parameter, its contents will  disappear after it stops running. When building the image, you might need to anticipate the user\ns need to communicate with the app inside the container over the network or to pass files in and out of the container.\n\n\nAccessing Network Ports in the Container\n\n\nIn the JSDetox example above, the application listens on TCP port 3000. In its default configuration, JSDetox listens on localhost, which would make its port inaccessible from outside its Docker container. This is why we launched JSDetox with the \n-l $HOSTNAME\n parameter\nthis directed the application to listen on the network interface that could be accessed from outside the container.\n\n\nUnless the user explicitly requests access to the container\ns port when launching its image, no ports will be accessible from the underlying system. Fortunately, Docker allows us to use the \n-p\n parameter to specify that a specific port within the container should be accessible from outside the container. For example, to access JSDetox\n port 3000, the user needs to specify \n-p 3000:3000\n. This maps the container\ns port 3000 to the underlying host\ns port 3000, allowing the user to communicate with JSDetox by connecting to http://localhost:3000 using a web browser.\n\n\nSharing Files with the Container\n\n\nThere is no need to share files with JSDetox inside the container by using the file system, because this application interacts with the user through the web browser. In contrast, some files expect the user to provide input or share output via the file system. Docker supports the \n-v\n parameter to share a directory between the underlying host and the container.\n\n\nFor example, let\ns say we wanted to share a folder with the container running the \nRekall Memory Forensic Framework\n, which is \navailable from the REMnux Docker repository\n. If the memory image file that you\nd like to analyze is located on your underlying host in the ~/files directory, you could share that directory with the Rekall container by specifying \n-v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files\n when running the application\ns image:\n\n\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v ~/files:/home/nonroot/files remnux/rekall bash\n\n\n\nThis maps the local ~/files directory to the /home/nonroot/files directory inside the container. The Rekall image is built to run the user-designated command (e.g., \nbash\n) as the user \nnonroot\n. To ensure that the non-root user has access to the underlying hosts ~/files directory, the user of the app will need to make that directory world-accessible (i.e., \nchmod a+xwr ~/files\n) before launching the container.\n\n\nThe comments in the beginning of your Dockerfile should provide guidelines for how the image should be launched to ensure that the user can provide files and communicate with ports.",
