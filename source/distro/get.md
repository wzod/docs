The heart of the [REMnux](https://REMnux.org/)&trade; project is the REMnux Linux distribution based on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). This lightweight distro incorporates many tools for analyzing Windows and Linux malware, examining browser-based threats such as obfuscated JavaScript, exploring suspicious document files and taking apart other malicious artifacts. Investigators can also use the distro to intercept suspicious network traffic in an isolated lab when performing behavioral malware analysis.

## Connecting REMnux to the Internet

The REMnux virtual appliance is configured to use the "host-only" network, isolating the REMnux instance from the physical network. To connect REMnux to the network, for instance, to provide it with Internet access, change the settings of the virtual appliance to the appropriate network, such as "NAT" then issue the `renew-dhcp` command in REMnux.
