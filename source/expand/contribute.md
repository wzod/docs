# Contribute Your Expertise

REMnux&trade; is maintained by [Lenny Zeltser](http://zeltser.com) with extensive help from [David Westcott](https://twitter.com/beast_fighter). We could use your assistance! There are several ways in which you can also contribute to the project.

## Documentation

Write documentation for tools installed on the REMnux distro to expand the tips and guidelines that already exist in the [How to Use REMnux Tools](../distro/use.md) section. Please format your document using the popular and easy-to-use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), then [send your docs to Lenny Zeltser](http://zeltser.com/about/contact.html).

## Dockerfile Configurations

Create Dockerfile configs for building Docker images of malware analysis applications that are not yet present in the [REMnux Docker image collection](../containers/run-apps.md). If you are new to Docker, you can learn how to [distribute and run apps inside containers](../containers/malware-analysis.md) and how to [build your own images](../containers/create-docker-images.md). Once you have built and tested your Dockerfile, [share it with Lenny Zeltser](http://zeltser.com/about/contact.html).

## Issues and Fixes

If you come across problems with tools available as part of REMnux, specially if you have suggestions for correcting the issues, please log them on the REMnux [distro repository](https://github.com/REMnux/distro/issues) or [Dockerfile repository](https://github.com/REMnux/docker/issues) on Github.
