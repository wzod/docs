# Contribute Your Expertise

REMnux&trade; is maintained by [Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/) with extensive help from [David Westcott](https://twitter.com/beast_fighter). We could use your assistance! There are several ways in which you can also contribute to the project.

## Documentation

Help document the tools installed on the REMnux distro.

Pick a [tool installed on REMnux](../distro/tools.md), then confirm that it doesn't already have a page in the [REMnux docs wiki](https://github.com/REMnux/docs/wiki). Then, document the tool by using the [documentation template](https://github.com/REMnux/docs/wiki/Documentation-Template) as a starting point. The page you write doesn't need to replace existing guides, but rather should provide a reference for REMnux distro users looking for a starting point. The page should be formatted according to the popular and easy-to-use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). Once you're done, please [send your docs to Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/contact/).

Alternatively, write-up an article explaining how to use one of the tools installed on REMnux and [send Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/contact/) the link, so he can include it in the [Using REMunux and Its Tools](../distro/use.md) section of the documentation site.

## Dockerfile Configurations

Create Dockerfile configs for building Docker images of malware analysis applications that are not yet present in the [REMnux Docker image collection](../containers/run-apps.md). If you are new to Docker, you can learn how to [distribute and run apps inside containers](../containers/malware-analysis.md) and how to [build your own images](../containers/create-docker-images.md). Once you have built and tested your Dockerfile, [share it with Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/contact/).

## Issues and Fixes

If you come across problems with tools available as part of REMnux, specially if you have suggestions for correcting the issues, please log them on the REMnux [distro repository](https://github.com/REMnux/distro/issues) or [Dockerfile repository](https://github.com/REMnux/docker/issues) on Github. You can also email your note to [Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/contact/).
