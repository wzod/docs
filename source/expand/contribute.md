# Contribute Your Expertise

REMnux is maintained by [Lenny Zeltser](http://zeltser.com) with extensive help from [David Westcott](https://twitter.com/beast_fighter). We could use your assistance! There are several ways in which you can also contribute to the project.

## Documentation

Write documentation for tools installed on the REMnux distro to expand the tips and guidelines that already exist in the [How to Use REMnux Tools](../distro/use.md) section. Please format your document using the popular and easy-to-use [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), then [send your docs to Lenny Zeltser](http://zeltser.com/about/contact.html).

## Dockerfile Configurations

Create Dockerfile configs for building Docker images of malware analysis applications that are not yet present in the [REMnux Docker hub repository](https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/remnux/). To learn more about this REMnux project, as well as to better understand Docker and how to run malware analysis apps in containers, see section [Docker Images for Malware Analysis](../containers/malware-analysis.md). It will also explain how you can contribute your images the REMnux collection.
