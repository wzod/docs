This repository contains the source for building the [REMnux documentation site](https://REMnux.org/docs). You can browse the properly-formatted documentation set there. The source files in the "master" branch are designed to be built using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), which produces HTML and related files stored in this "gh-pages" branch, which are displayed in their formatted form on the [REMnux documentation site](https://REMnux.org/docs) with the help of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
