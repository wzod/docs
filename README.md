This repository contains the source for building the [REMnux documentation site](https://REMnux.org/docs). You can browse the properly-formatted documentation set there. The source files in this "master" branch are designed to be built using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), which produces HTML and related files stored in the "gh-pages" branch, which are displayed in their formatted form on the [REMnux documentation site](https://REMnux.org/docs) with the help of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The [tools](tools/) directory in this repository includes documentation notes. Each page is meant to provide a brief reference about a specific tool installed on the REMnux distro. The listing of [Tools Installed on REMnux](https://remnux.org/docs/distro/tools/) should link to the corresponding pages hosted here. Consider contributing to the project [by documenting one of your favorite tools](https://remnux.org/docs/expand/contribute/#documentation) that doesn't already have a page there.
